# BikeDoctor

**Introduction**

Hello! You have landed on our project BikeDoctor!

This project intends to create an Online Vehicle Servicing Booking portal. The basic idea behind this portal is to provide a platform for customers to find a servicing centre nearby and book an appointment with them, rather than going physically and facing the waiting queues.

The Service centres can avail benefits from this portal by coming into the light for a mass customer base and getting more business. They can receive bookings, update status of the work and receive payments.

This project aims to ease the process of vehicle servicing and gaining a customer base.
